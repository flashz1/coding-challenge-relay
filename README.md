### Senior Full-Stack Engineer Task: Product Management System Enhancement

**Objective:** Enhance an existing Product Management System (PMS) to allow users to add, edit, and manage product listings seamlessly. We're expecting a mobile-first, responsive design, with a polished user experience and optimized performance.

#### 1. Initial Setup:

A boilerplate has been provided which is pre-configured with Next.js, Flow, and a GraphQL server. The home page with the list of products is already set up. Your task is to build upon this.

#### 2. Define Routes and Data Structure:

**Products should consist of:** ID, name, a brief description, price, and category.

**Implement a new route:**

- "/create" - for adding new products.

#### 3. UI Enhancement with Material-UI:

**Homepage:**
A user should be able to go to the product creation page. Implement it as you think is the best.

**Product Creation Form:**
Craft a form to allow users to add new products.
Ensure the form is intuitive, featuring fields for all product attributes and error handling for incorrect or missing inputs.

#### 4. Enhance Data Management using React-Relay and GraphQL:

**Design GraphQL mutations and query to add a new product.**
Utilize React Relay to manage data, ensuring efficient communication between the GraphQL server and React components, especially for the mutation you implement.

#### 5. Prioritize Responsive Design:

Ensure a mobile-first approach and that components adapt elegantly to desktop sizes. Test your solution across varied devices: iPhone X, MacBook 13‚Äù.

#### 6. Advanced Testing:

Implement unit tests for components, hooks, and other functionalities you introduce.
As a senior role, comprehensive tests are crucial; ensure both primary scenarios and edge cases are considered.

#### Tech Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the framework.
- [Flow](https://flow.org/) for static type checking.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for the API.
- [React Relay](https://relay.dev/) for efficient data fetching.
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) for the UI components.

**Note:** Given your senior position, we're keen on evaluating not only the features you implement but also your coding approach, design decisions, and problem-solving skills. Strive for clean, maintainable code that embodies advanced engineering best practices.
Wishing you success!
